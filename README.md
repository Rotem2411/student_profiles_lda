# Student Profiles - LDA Topic Modeling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing topic modeling on student profile texts using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze textual data from student scholarship applications and identify dominant themes across the dataset. This is achieved using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on:

- Preprocessing Hebrew text data
- Tokenization and lemmatization
- Applying LDA for topic modeling
- Visualizing topics and distributions

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `student_profiles_lda.ipynb` â€” Main notebook containing code for preprocessing, training the LDA model, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt` *(optional)* â€” List of required packages (can be generated on request).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Gensim
- spaCy
- matplotlib / pyLDAvis
- pandas, numpy
